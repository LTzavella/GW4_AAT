## Analyses scripts for "Effects of inhibitory control training on food-related action tendencies, liking and choice" 

### Analyses scripts

> Due to GDPR constraints, all data (raw and summary files) are only available on our OSF project component page: https://osf.io/eu6xj/

#### Downloading data for pre-processing 
* Download/clone the the folder 'Analyses scripts' on your local machine.
* Download the 'raw_data' folder from the OSF data repository and add to the folder with the analyses scripts. 
* Data csvs need to be stored in a folder called 'raw_data' and not a renamed or different directory.

#### Pre-processing pipeline
* Please note that we have already provided a summary data file (see folder 'summary_files' on OSF - https://osf.io/eu6xj/) for all analyses for convenience and pre-processing can be skipped.
* If you wish to check the pre-processing steps or make alterations, please open the 'GW4_Analyses.RProj' and in your R session select the script '1.Pre_processing.Rmd'.
* This script will require the raw_data folder as mentioned above. The scripts produce multiple summary files, but on OSF we have kept one data file with all variables that are renamed for convenience. A data guide that explains all variables has also been uploaded.
