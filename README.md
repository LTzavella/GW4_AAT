## Analyses and preprint materials for pre-registered project: "A multi-site study investigating the effects of inhibitory control training on automatic action tendendies"

### Analyses scripts

> Due to GDPR constraints, all data (raw and summary files) are only available on our OSF project component page: https://osf.io/eu6xj/

#### Downloading data for pre-processing 
* Download/clone the the folder 'Analyses scripts' on your local machine.
* Download the 'raw_data' folder from the OSF data repository and add to the folder with the analyses scripts. 
* Data csvs need to be stored in a folder called 'raw_data' and not a renamed or different directory.
* Download 'summary_processed.csv' from the same OSF page and add to the folder with the analyses scripts. 

#### Pre-processing pipeline
* Please note that we have already provided summary files (see folder 'summary_files' on OSF - https://osf.io/eu6xj/) for all analyses for convenience and pre-processing can be skipped.
* If you wish to check the pre-processing steps or make alterations, please open the 'GW4_Analyses.RProj' and in your R session select the script '1.Pre_processing.Rmd'.
* This script will require the raw_data folder as mentioned above and the summary_processed.csv file. It will produce the same summary files for analyses.
