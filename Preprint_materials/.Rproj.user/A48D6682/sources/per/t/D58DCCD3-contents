# Does inhibitory control training have an effect on automatic action tendencies for unhealthy foods? {#ch2}

## Introduction {#ch2_introduction}

\par

The recent rise in overweight and obesity rates can primarily be attributed to the over-consumption of energy-dense foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt content [@whoObesityOverweight2018]. Individuals are constantly exposed to visual cues of such foods in the environment (e.g., through advertisements) and this often leads to increased cravings and subsequent food intake [@havermans_pavlovian_2013]. A theoretical explanation for overeating has been provided by dual-process models which argue that behaviour is determined by the interaction of impulsive (*automatic*) and reflective (*controlled*) processes [@strack_reflective_2004; @kakoschke_combined_2015]. For example, over-consumption of unhealthy foods can be ascribed to a heightened approach bias towards food cues in the environment, which can result in increased food intake if these automatic action tendencies are not regulated via controlled processes, such as inhibitory control [@kakoschke_effect_2017]. Such theoretical frameworks have led to the development of behaviour change interventions for unhealthy eating behaviours that target either automatic or controlled processing, such as approach bias modification and inhibitory control training respectively [see @kakoschke_approach_2017; @jonesCognitiveTrainingPotential2018 for recent reviews]. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the interaction between automatic and controlled processing in the context of inhibitory control training (ICT). Specifically, we tested whether food-specific ICT could influence individuals' automatic action tendencies towards unhealthy foods.  

\par
In the dual-process framework (see section \ref{ch1_dual}), unhealthy eating behaviours may be explained by a weak reflective system and/or a strong impulsive system [e.g., @lawrence_nucleus_2012; @nederkoorn_specificity_2012]. These systems are often in conflict; for example, when an individual has to decide whether or not to consume an unhealthy food, automatic attentional (e.g., attending to the cue) and motivational (e.g., approaching the food) processes would antagonize the controlled process of considering long-term goals such as losing weight when an individual has to decide on an action, that is to eat or not eat the food [@kakoschke_combined_2015]. This study focuses on an automatic process known as approach bias, which is the automatic action tendency to approach an appetitive (food) cue in the environment, rather than avoid it [@wiers_automatic_2013]. An approach bias has been demonstrated for a variety of energy-dense foods in both obese and healthy-weight individuals [@brignell_attentional_2009; @kemps_approach_2015; @kemps_implicit_2013; @veenstra_restrained_2010]. Interestingly, @kakoschke_combined_2015 found that approach bias alone did not predict increased intake of unhealthy foods, but it was the interaction between approach bias and inhibitory control that was the significant determinant of subsequent behaviour. The authors report that approach bias had the expected effect on food intake only for participants with low inhibitory control. As discussed in Chapter 1 (see section \ref{ch1_inhibition}), an important component of controlled processing is inhibitory control, which refers to the ability to inhibit behaviours and impulses that are incompatible with higher-order goals, such as wanting to lose weight [@houben_too_2012], and encompasses several elements, such as response inhibition and cognitive flexibility [see @bartholdySystematicReviewRelationship2016]. Inhibitory control capacity is often measured via response inhibition paradigms, such as the go/no-go task [@dondersSpeedMentalProcesses1969; @newmanPassiveAvoidanceLearning1986] and stop-signal task [@loganAbilityInhibitSimple1984; @lappinUseDelayedSignal1966], and has been associated with unhealthy eating behaviours [e.g., @jasinska_impulsivity_2012;  @guerrieri_influence_2007; @hall_executive_2012]. For example, @nederkoorn_control_2010 showed that strong implicit preferences for snacks paired with low 'inhibitory control capacity' predicted weight gain over one year. Overall, there is evidence to suggest that both inhibitory control and motivational processes are important determinants of eating-related behaviour. 

\par
Complementary evidence for the role of automatic and controlled processes in the regulation of eating behaviours stems from the line of research dedicated to the development of health behaviour change interventions. Approach bias modification training is commonly delivered via an approach-avoidance task [AAT; @neumann_approach_2000; @rinck_approach_2007; @wiers_should_2013] and has been found to be effective in re-training approach bias for foods [@brockmeyer_approach_2015-1] and even reduce food intake in the laboratory [@schumacher_bias_2016; see @kakoschke_approach_2017 for review]. The AAT is assumed to capture automatic action tendencies when participants are instructed to respond to task-irrelevant feature such as the orientation (portrait or landscape) of the presented picture, by pulling or pushing a joystick [@wiers_automatic_2013]. The AAT can also pair actions with visual feedback, so that the picture gets bigger when participant pull the joystick towards them (zoom-in) and gets smaller when they push it away (zoom-out). Arm extension could indicate an approach response towards an appetitive food (object-reference) or an avoidance response when the food is pushed away from the body/self [@phaf_approach_2014] and thus visual feedback provides the self-reference attribute to the responses (e.g., object comes closer to one’s body). The 'zooming' feature disambiguates the mapping of responses to approach and avoidance actions, whereby pulling the joystick represents approach and pushing it reflects avoidance [@neumann_approach_2000]. In AAT training, contingencies between actions and stimuli are manipulated so that appetitive cues are associated with push actions (avoidance) and neutral items are paired with pull actions (approach). 

\par
In the context of controlled processes, ICT interventions involve cue-specific go/no-go or stop-signal tasks whereby participants are instructed to make a speeded choice response to appetitive stimuli such as foods or alcohol, but to withhold that response when a visual, or auditory, signal is presented. In go/no-go training, signal-stimulus mappings are manipulated so that appetitive cues (e.g., unhealthy foods) are consistently paired with a stop signal. Stopping to unhealthy foods has been shown to reduce food consumption [@adams_training_2017; @houben_chocolate_2015; @houben_training_2011; @lawrence_stopping_2015; @veling_using_2011; also see @allomDoesInhibitoryControl2016 for meta-analysis] and promote healthy food choices in the laboratory [@veling_stop_2013; @veling_training_2017]. ICT protocols have even been associated with increased weight loss [@lawrence_training_2015; @veling_targeting_2014]. A potential mechanism of action behind ICT effects on food consumption is stimulus devaluation [@veling_what_2017], whereby the evaluations of appetitive foods are reduced during training to facilitate performance when response inhibition is required [e.g., @chen_how_2016]. A possible explanation for this devaluation effect is provided by the Behaviour Stimulus Interaction (BSI) theory which posits that food stimuli are devalued when negative affect is induced to resolve the ongoing conflict between triggered approach reactions to appetitive foods and the need to inhibit responses towards those stimuli [@chen_how_2016; @veling_what_2017; @veling_when_2008]. When a food is devalued, the approach bias towards that cue is reduced and inhibition can successfully take place. It is possible that this reduction in approach bias can be observed after go/no-go training^[It should be noted that a link between affect and motivation is also included in the dual-process framework of (eating) behaviour, as discussed in Chapter 1 (see section \ref{ch1_rim}).]. 

\par
Theoretically, the effects of ICT could also be explained by hard-wired connections between Pavlovian appetitive/ aversive centres [dickinson_mechanisms_2014] and go/no-go responses [@mclaren_association_2016; @verbruggen_inhibitory_2014]. @verbruggen_inhibitory_2014 suggest that conditioned inhibitory control in ICT paradigms, such as go/no-go training, can have an influence not only on the evaluations of stimuli, but also their motivational value via links to the appetitive/aversive centres. For example, a stimulus consistently paired with stopping on signal trials would be devalued and the approach motivation for that stimulus could also be reduced via a hard-wired excitatory connection between the 'stop' system and the aversive centre [also see @dickinson_mechanisms_2014; @mclaren_association_2016]. Similarly, approach bias for foods consistently paired with go responses on no-signal trials could be increased via the link between the 'go' system and the appetitive centre.

\par
This study attempts to answer this question by employing a go/no-go training paradigm with unhealthy food stimuli and measuring automatic action tendencies via an AAT before and after training. We tested whether individuals would show reduced approach bias for the foods associated with response inhibition and/or increased approach bias for the foods paired with go responses after training. Consistent with previous ICT literature, the study also examined impulsive food choice and food liking as secondary training outcomes. The research study was conducted as part of the GW4 Undergraduate Psychology Consortium 2017/2018 and data were collected across Cardiff University, University of Exeter and University of Bath campuses. 


## Hypotheses {#ch2_hypotheses}

All hypotheses described in this section are confirmatory and have been preregistered\footnote{Exact hypotheses from the preregistered protocol have been re-ordered according to outcomes for clarity. There were no deviations from the protocol for the hypotheses and corresponding statistical tests, with the exception of minor alterations regarding the supplementary frequentist statitics (see section \ref{ch2_prereg_analyses}).} on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/wav8p/). Effects of ICT (go/no-go training; see section \ref{ch2_gng}) on automatic action tendencies (see section \ref{ch2_aat}) and liking (see section \ref{ch2_food_ratings}) for unhealthy foods were investigated using change scores from pre-to post-training for both outcomes (H1, H3). The training condition was also expected to have an effect on food choice behaviour (H2; see section \ref{ch2_food_choice}). The study assessed contingency learning mechanisms for the training paradigm, as a manipulation check (H4).  

### Training effects on automatic action tendencies

The primary outcome measure in the study was the change in automatic action tendencies from pre-to post- ICT training for the foods associated with different conditions (go, no-go and control - see Figure \ref{fig:ch2_procedure}). Action tendencies were indirectly measured via the AAT and approach-avoidance bias scores were obtained by subtracting the median completion response times (RTs; for details see section \ref{ch2_measures_indices}) in avoid trials (push action) from the RTs in approach trials (pull action) at the participant level (correct responses only), for each training condition and then calculating the change from pre-to post-training. It was hypothesised that ICT training would lead to a reduction in approach bias for no-go foods and potential increase in approach bias for go foods compared to the control foods. \newline

\noindent H1. There would be evidence for an effect of training condition (go, no-go, control) on the change in approach-avoid bias scores from pre-to post-training.
\begin{itemize}
\item[H1a.] Participants would show a reduction in approach bias for no-go foods compared to the control foods, from pre-to post- training.
\item[H1b.] Participants would have increased approach bias towards go foods relative to the control foods, from pre-to post- training.
\end{itemize}

### Training effects on impulsive food choices

As a secondary outcome, the effects of ICT on impulsive food choices for unhealthy foods were tested by comparing the probabilities of choosing a food from each training condition. \newline

\noindent H2. It was expected that after ICT participants would show reduced impulsive choices for no-go foods and increased choices for go foods relative to control foods. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[H2a.] The probability of choosing a no-go food would be lower than the probability of choosing a control food.
\item[H2b.] The probability of choosing a go food would be higher than the probability of choosing a control food.
\end{itemize}

### Training effects on food evaluations

The mean change in food liking ratings from pre-to post-training was examined in order to test whether go/no-go (GNG) training led to the devaluation of no-go foods compared to control foods (H3a). It should be noted that this was not a positive control for training effectiveness, as the findings for stimulus devaluation outcomes remain controversial [see @jones_inhibitory_2016 for meta-analysis]. Nonetheless, stimulus devaluation in this study was treated both as a manipulation check for the employed training paradigm and a secondary outcome measure. The possibility that positive evaluations for go foods would be increased after training compared to the control foods was also considered and tested in a separate hypothesis (H3b). \newline

\noindent H3. There would be evidence for an effect of training condition (go, no-go, control) on the change in food liking from pre-to post-training.

\begin{itemize}
\item[H3a.] Participants would show reduced liking for no-go foods relative to the control foods, from pre-to post- training.
\item[H3b.] Participants would show increased liking for go foods relative to the control foods, from pre-to post- training.\footnote{This was only a hypothesis for secondary outcomes, as stimulus devaluation is exclusively defined as a reduction in positive evaluations for foods associated with no-go responses during training.}
\end{itemize}

### Contingency learning during training

Contingency learning was a more fundamental manipulation check for GNG training. ICT paradigms, such as the go/no-go training task, might lead to stimulus-response associations and learning can be observed in both reaction times and error rates [e.g., @lawrence_training_2015; see @best_instructed_2019]. The proportion of correct responses on signal trials (i.e., successful stops) and the mean reaction times from no-signal (go) trials were compared for specific training conditions, as stated in the hypotheses below. \newline

\noindent H4. Go/no-go training would result in contingency learning in terms of reaction times on no-signal trials and the percentage of successful inhibitions on signal trials. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[H4a.] The proportion of correct responses on signal trials would be greater for no-go foods compared to the control foods associated with a signal (control\textsubscript{nogo}).
\item[H4b.] Go reaction times would be faster for go foods compared to the control foods presented on no-signal trials (control\textsubscript{go}).
\end{itemize}

## Methods {#ch2_methods}

### Participants {#ch2_participants}

\par
A total of 255 participants were recruited in total from the University campuses of Cardiff, Bath and Exeter\footnote{\textbf{Contribution note.} The data were collected by undergraduate students in line with the GW4 Undergraduate Psychology Consortium 2017/2018 guidelines. In laboratory data collection, all experimental tasks and relevant forms (e.g., consent, debrief) were programmed by me as a single fully automated script in order to minimise the need for the involvement of the researcher(s) during testing sessions. Students only run selected frequentist statistical tests on preregistered hypotheses and exploratory analyses for moderators (see section \ref{ch2_questionnaires}), which are not reported in this thesis.} via research participation schemes (e.g., Experimental Management system; EMS) and advertisements (see Figure \ref{fig:ch2_recruitment} for recruitment details). Participants recruited through participation schemes received course credits, whereas other individuals were offered entry into a prize draw for one of three £20 shopping vouchers. Participants were informed about the study eligibility criteria, completed a screening survey in the beginning of the study and provided their consent. They were asked to refrain from eating for 3 hours before the study. Participants had to be at least 18 years of age, be fluent in spoken and written English and have normal or corrected-to-normal vision, including normal colour vision. Participants were excluded if they were dieting at the time of the study, with a weight goal and time-frame in mind, if they had a current and/or past diagnosis of any eating disorder(s) or they had a body-mass-index (BMI) lower than 18.5 kg/m$^{2}$ (i.e., underweight category). All screening questions can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix_shared}. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of Cardiff University, University of Bath and the University of Exeter. 

### Sampling plan {#ch2_sampling}

\par
The required sample size was estimated based on a frequentist power analysis conducted for the primary outcome measure (i.e., change in approach-avoidance bias, from pre-to post-training, between go and no-go foods; H1a and H1b) and the stimulus devaluation manipulation check (i.e., change in food liking, from pre-to-post training, between go and no-go foods; H3). Both of these effect sizes were in the medium range and therefore calculations were based on the primary outcome measure. For an expected effect size, other studies that have measured approach bias pre-and post-approach-avoidance training [@becker_approach_2015-1; @schumacher_bias_2016] were considered. Both studies reported an effect size of \textit{$\eta$\textsubscript{p}$^{2}$} = 0.07 which corresponds to a ‘medium’ effect size (\textit{dz} = 0.50). @becker_approach_2015-1 also reported two non-significant results, although effect sizes were not provided. Note, however, that @becker_approach_2015-1 compared an active group with 90:10 mapping (i.e., avoidance of 90% for unhealthy trials and 10% healthy trials) to a control group with 50:50 mapping whereas @schumacher_bias_2016 compared a 90:10 active group with a 10:90 control group. A conservative approach was followed for the sample size calculation. Firstly, the effect size was reduced by 33% (i.e., *dz* = 0.34) to account for publication bias [@buttonPowerFailureWhy2013] and secondly an alpha of 0.005 was used, which has recently been recommended for any research that cannot be considered a direct replication and can increase the reliability of new discoveries [@benjamin_redefine_2017]. Based on a priori power calculations using G*Power [@faul_statistical_2009] it was estimated that a total sample of 149 participants\footnote{Due to the large number of participant exclusions based on mean error rates in the AAT (see Figure A1) and the group testing laboratory setting at Cardiff University, final recruitment led to the expected sample size including 14 more participants (N=163).} was necessary for 90% power. 

\par  
The sampling method and power analysis of the study adopted a conservative frequentist approach, but the preregistered analyses were based on a Bayesian framework (see section \ref{ch2_prereg_analyses}). Frequentist analyses were also reported in a supplementary fashion ($\alpha$ = 0.005). Bayes factors (BFs) informed the interpretations of the results and the guidelines by @lee_bayesian_2013 were followed to indicate the evidential strenth of the BFs. A threshold of *BF*\textsubscript{10} > 6 (and *BF*\textsubscript{10} < 10) was used to indicate *moderate* evidence for the alternative hypothesis relative to the null, and *BF*\textsubscript{10} < 1/6 (and *BF*\textsubscript{10} > 1/10) reflected *moderate* evidence for the null relative to the respective alternative hypothesis. Bayes factor analyses were favoured for drawing conclusions from the study, as they would allow us to interpret null outcomes as evidence of absence when traditional analyses would not make such inferences feasible.

\caption{\textbf{Schematic diagram of the study procedure, go/no-go training and approach-avoidance tasks.} \textbf{A.} After completing the screening and initial survey, participants rated all food stimuli (liking) and proceeded to perform the pre-training approach-avoidance task (AAT) blocks. In the training phase, participants completed six blocks of go/no-go training. The post-training AAT blocks were then presented and followed by food liking ratings. At the end of the study, participants completed a short food choice task and several questionnaires, in random order. \textbf{B.} The go/no-go training paradigm involved go (no-signal) and no-go (signal) trials that occurred with equal probability. On go trials, participants had to respond within 1250ms by pressing the "C" and "M" keys to indicate the picture location (left or right, respectively). On no-go trials, participants were instructed not to respond at all. The inter-trial interval (ITI) was 1250ms. Food categories were randomly assigned to three conditions. Go foods were only paired with no-signal trials and no-go foods were always associated with signal trials. Control, or filler, foods were presented in both signal and no-signal trials (50:50). \textbf{C.} In the AAT, participants were asked to respond according to the format of the presented picture (portrait or landscape). Response-format assignments were approximately counterbalanced across participants. As an example, on approach trials a participant would have to pull the mouse towards them when the picture was in portrait format (approach trial) and push it away from them when the picture was in landscape format. Push and pull actions were paired with visual feedback, that is, zoom-out and zoom-in effects respectively. The maximum reaction time (maxRT) was 1500ms and the ITI was set to 500ms. Participants clicked on a central "X" to begin a trial (self-timed start).}

### Procedure {#ch2_procedure}

An overview of the study procedure can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ch2_procedure} (panel A). After screening, eligible participants were provided with a short survey (see section \ref{ch2_questionnaires}) and proceeded to rate all food categories on how much they like the taste (see section \ref{ch2_food_ratings}). Three blocks of the approach-avoidance task (see section \ref{ch2_aat}) were completed before the go/no-go training paradigm was performed (see section \ref{ch2_gng}). Rated food categories were randomly assigned to three conditions for training: go, no-go and control, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ch2_procedure} (panel B). Post-training, participants were presented with another three blocks of the AAT, provided ratings for all food stimuli again and finally completed a short food choice task (see section \ref{ch2_food_choice}). At the end of the study, several questionnaires were presented in random order and participants were debriefed about the aims of the study. All study components were programmed using Inquisit Lab [@inquisit_5] and run online across data collection sites via Inquisit Web. 


### Go/No-go training {#ch2_gng}

\par
The Go/No-Go (GNG) training paradigm involved go and no-go responses to six pre-selected energy-dense food categories. Food categories differed in terms of taste, so that three foods were savoury (i.e., pizza, crisps, chips) and three foods were sweet (i.e., biscuits, chocolate, cake)\footnote{All study materials are openly available at https://osf.io/wcf4r/.}. Two food categories were randomly assigned to each training condition (go, no-go, filler foods) in the beginning of the experiment and food taste was counterbalanced so that each condition had one sweet and one savoury food. There were three training conditions according to the mapping of foods to signal (no-go) and no-signal (go) trials in the GNG. All go foods appeared in go (no-signal) trials and all no-go foods were presented in no-go (signal) trials (see Figure \ref{fig:ch2_procedure}, panel B). Control, or filler, foods appeared on both go and no-go trials with equal probability (50:50). Each food category had three exemplars which appeared twice in each block. 

\par
All foods were presented on either the left or right side of the screen within a rectangle for 1250ms, which was the maximum reaction time (maxRT), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ch2_procedure}, panel B. Participants were asked to respond to the location of the food as quickly and as accurately as possible by pressing the "C" and "M" buttons on the keyboard with their left and right index fingers, respectively. The central rectangle remained on the screen throughout the training, including the inter-trial-interval (ITI), which was 1250ms. On signal trials, the rectangle turned bold, indicating that participants should withhold their response. In line with the GNG training paradigm, this signal appeared on stimulus onset (i.e., no delay between stimulus and signal) and stayed on the screen until the end of the trial. A correct response on no-signal trials was registered when participants responded accurately to the location of the food within the maxRT window and a successful stop (i.e., correct signal trial) was considered when participants did not respond at all. Incorrect responses in no-signal trials refer to either to a wrong location judgement or a missed response. Left and right responses were counterbalanced across all manipulated variables for each type of trial. Training was split into 6 blocks of 36 trials (216 trials in total) and lasted approximately 10 minutes with inter-block breaks (15s). Task practice included 12 trials of go and no-go responses (50% - 50%) and participants responded to the location of grey squares, instead of food pictures. For the practice trials, accuracy feedback  was provided during the ITI.

### Approach avoidance task {#ch2_aat}

\par
The approach-avoidance task was adapted from an existent paradigm [@rinck_approach_2007; @wiers_relatively_2009], which involves ‘pull’ (i.e., towards self) and ‘push’ (i.e, away from self) movements of a joystick. Each type of motor response is paired with visual feedback so that when the joystick is pulled, the image gets bigger (zoom-in) and when it is pushed, the image gets smaller (zoom-out). As previously explained, this ‘zooming’ feature acts as an exteroceptive cue of either an approach or avoidance response [@neumann_approach_2000] and complements the proprioceptive properties of the task, where responses requiring arm flexion and extension correspond to approach and avoidance trials, respectively [@wiers_relatively_2009]. The evaluation-irrelevant feature of the paradigm was also incorporated and participants responded according to the format of the picture [portrait or landscape; e.g., @wiers_retraining_2010].

\par
AAT responses involved ‘push’ and ‘pull’ movements of the computer mouse (adaptation of the joystick version). Food stimuli were presented in the centre of the screen and participants were instructed to pull the mouse towards them or push the mouse away from them according to whether the image was in portrait or landscape format (see Figure \ref{fig:ch2_procedure}, panel C). Response-format assignments were approximately counterbalanced across participants (45.4\% portrait-approach, 54.6\% landscape-approach). Instructions highlighted moving the mouse cursor until it reaches the end of the screen (top or bottom edge) for a correct response to be registered and making smooth whole-arm movements. Participants had 1500ms to respond after the stimulus appeared. Each trial started with a central ‘X’ on the screen and participants had to click on it to begin (self-timed start). The ITI was 500ms and there was no delay between the ‘X’ click response and the stimulus onset. In order to account for the natural movement of the mouse, pixel tolerance was added to every mouse movement ($\pm$ 1.25% of display height), including movement initiation in the beginning of the trial. A response in the AAT was registered as correct only when participants completed the correct action (e.g., pull or push) within the maxRT window and also initiated a movement towards the correct direction. Even if the final response was correct, participants could have changed their movement after making an initial error (e.g., pull instead of push the mouse in an 'avoid' trial) and therefore the direction of their initial movement was also taken into account. The complete RT for an AAT trial was defined as the time from the stimulus onset to the successful completion of a response (i.e., completion time) and was used for the bias score calculations (see section \ref{ch2_measures_indices}). 

\par
Each AAT block consisted of 72 trials and go, no-go and control foods appeared with equal probability for both ‘pull’ (approach) and ‘push’ (avoid) responses. There were 12 approach and 12 avoid trials for each training condition (e.g., no-go) and within those trials, there were six savoury and six sweet foods presented (i.e., three exemplars repeated twice). Three AAT blocks were performed before training (AAT\textsubscript{pre}) and three after training (AAT\textsubscript{post}). Two constraints were placed on the quasi-random order of the trials within an AAT block. There were no more than three images of the same food category being presented consecutively and no more than three trials with the same picture format in sequence. AAT practice consisted of 10 trials with grey rectangles instead of food stimuli and accuracy feedback. The screen background for the AAT was black and the task lasted approximately 15 minutes, including the inter-block 15s breaks, where participants received a reminder of the main instructions.


### Food liking ratings {#ch2_food_ratings}

\par
Participants provided food liking ratings before and after training using a visual analogue scale (VAS). They rated all foods included in the GNG paradigm according to how much they liked the taste ("How much do you like the taste of this food?"), ranging from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very much). Task instructions encouraged participants to imagine they were tasting the food in their mouth and then rate how much they liked the taste. The cursor position was initially set to 50 for each food. The order of the presented foods was randomised and each block consisted of 18 trials. 

### Food choice task {#ch2_food_choice}

Impulsive food choices were assessed using a food choice task adapted from @veling_stop_2013, which included all food categories from the GNG paradigm (two exemplars per category). The twelve foods were presented on a grid layout, in a random order, and participants had ten seconds to select three foods that they would like to consume the most at that specific time, by clicking on them with the computer mouse. Participants were asked to click on a 'start' button to begin the trial and when a response was registered the selected food stimulus disappeared from the screen. This task element was introduced to prevent participants from deliberating on their choices and changing their initial responses, which would mean that *impulsive* food choices were no longer measured. Task instructions did not mention whether the nature of their choices would be consequential or hypothetical (i.e., whether they would get a food item at the end of the study or not). 

### Survey & Questionnaires {#ch2_questionnaires}

\par
Eligible participants were presented with an initial survey to record demographics and other variables for exploratory analyses. The survey consisted of height and weight measurements to calculate participant's body-mass-index (BMI; kg/m$^{2}$), the number of hours since their last meal ('less than 3 hours ago', '3-5 hours ago', '5-10 hours ago', 'more than 10 hours ago') and hunger state at the the time of the study (VAS: 1="Not at all" to 9="Very"). Gender was also recorded with the options of male, female, transgender male, transgender female, gender variant/non-conforming, and an open-ended text response for ‘other’.

\par
Several questionnaires were completed by the participants at the end of the study for exploratory analyses, as part of the undergraduate student projects of the GW4 Undergraduate Psychology Consortium 2017/2018. The Barratt Impulsivity Scale [BIS-15; @spinella_normative_2007] was introduced as a measure of impulsivity and the Stop Control Scale [SCS; @de_boer_stop_2011] was used to examine a distinctive element of general trait self-control, referred to as stop control. Other administered questionnaires included the Food Cravings Questionnaire - Trait - reduced  [FCQ-T-r; @meule_short_2014], Perceived Stress Scale [PSS; @cohen_global_1983] and the 'food' and 'money' subscales from the Delaying Gratification Inventory [DGI; @hoerger_development_2011].  A correlation matrix of main questionnaire measures and sample characteristics can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix_cormatrix}.

## Analyses

### Measures & indices {#ch2_measures_indices}

\par
The mean error rates in no-signal and signal trials as well as mean reaction time in no-signal trials (GoRT) from the GNG informed participant exclusions (see section \ref{ch2_data_exclusions}). For the contingency learning manipulation check (H4), measures included the proportion of successful stops from signal trials for no-go and control foods which were paired with a signal (control-nogo) and the mean GoRTs for each participant from correct go and control-go trials. 

\par
Performance in the AAT\textsubscript{pre} and AAT\textsubscript{post} blocks was considered only for correct responses. Median RTs for ‘push’ and ‘pull’ responses from all training condition levels were calculated for each participant\footnote{RTs were recorded continuously from movement initiation to response completion with samples every 33ms (two display refresh rates) to allow dynamic zoom-in/zoom-out effects based on participants' mouse movements. However, a bug was encountered with the version of the software and the temporal resolution at which coordinates and times were recorded was reduced. For this reason, linear interpolation was applied to increase the samples for every trial and obtain more precise RT measures. All details regarding this procedure can be found in the analyses scripts.}. Medians were used instead of means as they are less sensitive to outliers in RT distributions [also see @wiers_relatively_2009; @wiers_retraining_2010]. The approach-avoidance bias score for each condition was calculated as the difference between the median completion RTs for ‘push’ and’ pull’ responses (MedianRT\textsubscript{push}- MedianRT\textsubscript{pull}). Bias scores were computed for both AAT\textsubscript{pre} and AAT\textsubscript{post} blocks. Positive scores indicate an approach bias towards the foods of interest and negative scores reflect avoidance for those foods. Change scores for approach-avoid biases from pre-to post-training ($\Delta$AAT) were calculated for preregistered analyses (H1). The proportion of correct responses for each AAT design cell informed participant exclusions and exploratory analyses (see section \ref{ch2_accuracy_aat}).

\par
Participants were required to choose three foods out of twelve in the food choice task and selections could vary in their number for each training condition (go, no-go, control). Food choices were therefore normalised according to the total number of responses per participant (i.e., proportion). These calculated proportions, which were calculated for each participant were then compared across training conditions. For example, if a participant had chosen two go foods and one filler food, the probability (i.e., calculated proportion) of choosing a go food would be  0.667, the probability of choosing a filler food would be 0.333 and the probability of choosing a no-go food would be 0. Food rating VAS scores were averaged (mean) across the two foods per training condition (i.e., sweet and savoury foods for go, no-go and control conditions) and the three exemplars of each food. Changes in food liking from pre-to-post training ($\Delta$Liking) were compared for preregistered analyses. Pre-training scores were subtracted from post-training scores and negative values represent a reduction in liking ratings.

### Data exclusions {#ch2_data_exclusions}

\par
Participant-level data exclusions were conducted based on GNG training and AAT performance and participants who met any of the following criteria were excluded from all respective analyses. Participants who had a mean GoRT greater than three standard deviations from the group mean and percentage of correct responses in no-signal trials less than 85% were excluded. Participants were also excluded if their percentage of errors in signal trials was greater than three standard deviations from the group mean. For the AAT, participants were excluded if the percentage of errors in either pre- or post- AAT blocks greater than 25%. Additionally, participants who submitted a food rating of 50 (i.e., neutral) for 24 or more trials (~67%) either pre-or post-training would not be included as multiple such responses could indicate that participants skipped the rating trials by using the default setting of the VAS. 

### Preregistered analyses {#ch2_prereg_analyses}

\par
Data pre-processing and analyses were conducted in R [@R-base] via RStudio [@rstudio] and JASP [@JASP2018:1]. Preregistered analyses are described under their pre-specified hypotheses, as previously presented (see section \ref{ch2_hypotheses}). For all Bayesian paired samples t-tests mentioned hereinafter, a prior with the $\sqrt{2/2}$ scale parameter for the half-Cauchy distribution was used. All data are available at https://osf.io/eu6xj/ and R scripts can be found at https://osf.io/hz2nb/.\newline


\noindent H1. The effect of training condition on the change in approach-avoid bias scores from pre-to post-training was examined using Bayesian paired samples t-tests^[I have deviated from the preregistered analysis plan which specified a Bayesian Repeated Measures ANOVA, because it was not needed for only one main effect that would be examined via directional comparisons irrespective of the results. The same deviation applies to H3.], as shown below.\newline
\noindent H1a. $\Delta$AAT\textsubscript{nogo} <  $\Delta$AAT\textsubscript{control}\newline
H1b. $\Delta$AAT\textsubscript{go} >  $\Delta$AAT\textsubscript{control}\newline


\noindent H2. Two Bayesian paired samples t-tests were conducted for the mean proportions of selected foods in the go and no-go training condition compared to the control. \newline
H2a. p(no-go) < p(control)\newline
H2b. p(go) > p(control)\newline


\noindent H3. The effect of training condition on the change in food liking from pre-to post-training was examined using the directional Bayesian paired samples t-tests outlined below.\newline
H3a. $\Delta$Liking\textsubscript{nogo} < $\Delta$Liking\textsubscript{control}\newline
H3b. $\Delta$Liking\textsubscript{go} > $\Delta$Liking\textsubscript{control}\newline


\noindent H4. Contingency learning during go/no-go training was examined using Bayesian paired-samples t-tests for the percentage of successful inhibition trials and go RTs. \newline
H4a. PCsignal\textsubscript{nogo} > PCsignal\textsubscript{control-nogo}\newline
H4b. GoRT\textsubscript{go} < GoRT\textsubscript{control-go}
\newline
\par
The evidential value of confirmatory findings was solely determined by the Bayesian tests outlined in this section, as previously explained (see section \ref{ch2_sampling}). Frequentist tests were conducted in order to further the reproducibility of findings (e.g., potential use in meta-analyses). Paired samples t-tests were two-tailed, in line with the reported power analysis\footnote{Although Bonferroni corrections were preregistered for paired sample t-tests following Bayesian Repeated Measures ANOVAs, there were only two planned contrasts for each ANOVA and reflected distinct hypotheses about the data. Therefore, such corrections were not applied for the reported \textit{p}-values. Also, the ANOVAs were not conducted as previously noted.}. Contingency plans were not considered in case the normality assumption was violated for paired t-tests (Shapiro Wilk test: *p* $\leq$ .005), but appropriate exploratory analyses were conducted and reported in the \ref{ch2_robust} section\footnote{For other analyses reported in section \ref{ch2_exploratory}, \textit{p}-values from Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are reported as \textit{p\textsubscript{W}} in a supplementary manner.}. 

## Results

### Sample characteristics

After exclusions (see Figure \ref{fig:ch2_recruitment}), the final sample consisted of 163 participants (80.98\% female).  Participants had on average a healthy BMI (*M* = 22.88, *SD* = 2.98, range = 18.54 - 32.36) and their mean age was 22.39 (*SD* = 9.04, range = 18 - 59). 108 participants (66.26\%) reported that they had their last meal 3-5 hours before the study, while 24 participants (14.72\%)  did not adhere to the instruction not to eat 3 hours before. Hunger levels were not particularly high (*M* = 5.70, *SD* = 2.22).

\hl{\textbf{Issue here- Rachel's comment:} "The interaction is the important one because the effects for go and nogo are in opposite directions – so you would predict a non-sig main effect of training; Same for food liking / choice"}

All results for paired comparisons are shown in Table \ref{tab:ch2_prereg}. There was *moderate* evidence that the change in bias scores for no-go foods ($\Delta$AAT\textsubscript{nogo}; *M* = -3.31, *SD* = 62.91) was not reduced compared to the change for filler foods ($\Delta$AAT\textsubscript{control}; *M* = -1.81, *SD* = 59.55). Similar to H1a, there was *strong* evidence for the null compared to the alternative for H1b. The change in bias scores for go foods ($\Delta$AAT\textsubscript{go}; *M* = -10.47, *SD* = 59.57) was not greater than the change for filler foods. Approach-avoidance bias scores pre- and post-training across conditions have been visualised using rainclouds [@micah_allen_raincloudplots_2018; @10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15191.1] in Figure \ref{fig:ch2_raincloud_bias}.

#### Secondary training outcomes

\par
The effect of training on impulsive food choices was examined for no-go and go foods compared to control, as stated in H2a and H2b respectively. One participant did not complete the food choice task. There was *extreme* evidence that the probability of choosing a no-go food (*M* = 0.21, *SD* = 0.27) was lower than the probability of choosing a filler food (*M* = 0.36, *SD* = 0.31) after training (see Table \ref{tab:ch2_prereg}). There was only *anecdotal* evidence that probability of choosing a go food (*M* = 0.44, *SD* = 0.33) was not higher than the probability of choosing a filler food. Differences in food choice probabilities can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ch2_choices}.

\captionof{figure}{\textbf{Raincloud plot of the approach-avoidance bias scores pre- and post- training across training conditions.} There were no differences between the sample mean changes in approach-avoidance bias scores for no-go and go foods compared to control (filler) foods, as shown by the dashed lines. At a closer inspection, individual bias scores do not seem to be clustered around the positive end of the distribution as it would be expected for appetitive unhealthy foods, but actually show less dispersion around zero. Exploratory analyses confirmed that baseline bias scores for go, no-go and filler foods did not statistically deviate from zero (see section \ref{ch2_baseline_bias}). \textit{Note.} The `split-half violin' elements in the plot show smoothed distributions and boxplot vertical lines represent the range, excluding outliers based on the Interquartile Range.

\label{fig:ch2_choices}
\end{figure} 

\par
As a first manipulation check and secondary training outcome, it was investigated whether GNG changed the evaluations of foods associated with stopping (signal trials) during training compared to the evaluations of control foods which were paired with both go and stop responses with equal probability (50% signal, 50% no-signal). The change in liking scores from pre-to post-training for nogo foods ($\Delta$Liking\textsubscript{nogo}; *M* = -4.16; *SD* = 9.51) was only slightly reduced compared to change in liking for filler foods ($\Delta$Liking\textsubscript{control}; *M* = -2.61, *SD* = 8.77), and there was only *anecdotal* evidence for this effect (H3a; see Table \ref{tab:ch2_prereg}). The change in liking scores from pre-to post-training for go foods ($\Delta$Liking\textsubscript{go}; *M* = -2.87, *SD* = 10.15), however, was not greater than the change for filler foods as originally expected. Instead, there was *strong* evidence for the null hypothesis compared to the alternative (H3b).

#### Contingency learning

\par
In order to validate whether the implemented go/no-go training paradigm led to stimulus-response associations (i.e., contingency learning manipulation check), we tested whether the percentage of correct responses for no-go foods (i.e., successful inhibitions) would be greater compared to the percentage of correct responses for filler foods associated with signal trials (H4a). There was *extreme* evidence that participants had on average a higher proportion of successful inhibitions for no-go foods (PCsignal\textsubscript{nogo}; *M* = 0.97, *SD* = 0.03) than filler foods 
(PCsignal\textsubscript{control-nogo}; *M* = 0.96, *SD* = 0.04). Results are graphically presented in Figure \ref{fig:ch2_signal_accuracy}. For H4b, it was examined whether mean reaction times would be reduced for go foods (GoRT\textsubscript{go}; *M* = 507.00, *SD* = 70.48) compared to filler foods associated with no-signal trials (GoRT\textsubscript{control-go}; *M* = 515.00, *SD* = 75.51) and there was *extreme* evidence for such an effect. Therefore, contingency learning was observed in the employed GNG paradigm for both reaction time and accuracy outcomes.

The PC\textsubscript{signal} distribution for control foods was heavily skewed and this observation warranted a robustness check for effect estimates, as presented in the \ref{ch2_robust} section. \textit{Note.} The `split-half violin' elements in the plot show smoothed distributions. Individual data points have been jittered  to some degree due to overfitting, as it can be seen for the cluster of data points for very high proportions of correct responses. For example, when the proportion of correct responses on signal trials was 1.0 the individual data points were extended on the x-axis to enable their visualisation.}

### Findings from exploratory analyses {#ch2_exploratory}

#### Baseline approach bias scores {#ch2_baseline_bias}

Performance in the AAT was inspected further to check if approach bias for foods was present in the final sample and whether error rates differed across conditions. Although the sample means for AAT\textsubscript{pre} bias scores were negative for go foods (*M* = -2.32, *SD* = 58.14), no-go foods (*M* = -4.75, *SD* = 60.58) and filler foods (*M* = -4.48, *SD* = 52.25), individual data points (see Figure \ref{fig:ch2_raincloud_bias}) show less dispersion close to zero, suggesting that, on average, neither approach or avoidance bias was captured by the AAT. In line with previous literature [see Table 1 in @becker_approach_2015-1], this hypothesis was directly tested by examining whether baseline bias scores statistically deviated from zero using Bayesian one sample t-tests with the default prior settings for the two-sided alternative hypothesis that the population mean was not equal to the test value ($\neq$ 0). Equivalent frequentist tests were also conducted.  Overall, conclusive evidence for the absence of baseline bias was obtained (see Table \ref{tab:ch2_baseline}).

\par
As baseline bias scores calculated from completion times may be 'contaminated' by motor demands in this version of the AAT that requires computer mouse movements and arm flexion/extension, the possibility that motor initiation times may be more sensitive to capturing automatic action tendencies was considered. Movement initiation was registered when participants had moved their mouse cursor since starting a trial (i.e., stimulus onset), including the pixel tolerance for natural movements of the mouse (see section \ref{ch2_aat}). Therefore, tests were also conducted for baseline bias scores calculated using median initiation times, instead of median completion times. Consistent with the results presented above, there was strong evidence that baseline bias scores did not deviate from zero across training conditions (see Table \ref{tab:ch2_baseline}).

#### Sub-group analysis {#ch2_subgroup}

In an effort to show that the lack of a training effect on AAT outcomes was not due to the absence of baseline approach bias for unhealthy foods, a sub-group analysis for participants with positive baseline bias scores (N=72) was conducted. The findings from this exploratory analysis for food choice outcomes were consistent with the results reported in section \ref{ch2_training_outcomes}. There was *strong* evidence that the probability of choosing a no-go food (*M* = 0.20, *SD* = 0.27) was lower than the probability of choosing a control food (*M* = 0.37, *SD* = 0.33) [\textit{BF}\textsubscript{10} = 13.97; *t*(70)] = -2.96, *p* = 0.004, \textit{p\textsubscript{W}} = 0.004, *d* = -0.35, 95% CI for *d* = -0.59, -0.11]. There was *moderate* evidence for the absence of a general effect of training condition on the change in liking scores from pre-to post-training [*BF*\textsubscript{01} = 8.91; *F*(2, 142) = 0.94, *p* = 0.392]^[This analysis was conducted via a Bayesian Repeated Measures ANOVA with the default prior settings [@rouder_default_2012; @rouder_model_2016].]. With regards to the contingency learning manipulation check, there was *very strong* evidence for a greater proportion of correct responses in signal trials with no-go foods compared to control foods [*BF*\textsubscript{10} = 37.80; *t*(71) = 3.33, *p* = 0.001,\textit{p\textsubscript{W}} < .001, *d* = 0.39, 95% CI for *d* = 0.15, 0.63]. However, there was only *anecdotal* evidence that GoRTs were faster for go foods compared to control foods [*BF*\textsubscript{10} = 3.52; *t*(71)) = -2.38, *p* = 0.020, *d* = -0.28, 95% CI for *d* = -0.52, -0.04].

#### Accuracy in the approach-avoidance task {#ch2_accuracy_aat}

\par 
Although reaction times are the primary measure of interest for studies that utilise the AAT, an exploratory examination of error rates is also reported. At baseline, average error rates were not increased for trials where participants were required to avoid an appetitive food and complete a push action (*M* = 0.136, *SD* = 0.070) relative to trials where an approach (pull) action was completed (*M* = 0.143, *SD* = 0.066) [\textit{BF}\textsubscript{01} = 26.49; \textit{t}(162) = 1.42, \textit{p}= 0.159, \textit{d} = 0.11, 95% CI for \textit{d} = -0.04, 0.26]. However, after training, participants had on average more errors in approach trials (*M* = 0.124, *SD* = 0.074) compared to avoid trials (*M* = 0.105, *SD* = 0.062) [\textit{BF}\textsubscript{10} = 90.98, \textit{t}(162) = 3.64, \textit{p} < .001, \textit{p\textsubscript{W}} < .001, \textit{d} = 0.29, 95% CI for \textit{d} = 0.13, 0.44]. It is possible that training had a 'hidden' effect on accuracy, as for example it was more difficult to approach no-go foods compared to go and/or control foods due to a learned association between response inhibition and these food stimuli. Difference scores were calculated from the mean error rates post-training (pull - push) to check whether this increase in error rates was general or specific to training conditions. There was *very strong* evidence for the absence of a general effect of training condition on differences in mean error rates between approach and avoid trials [H3; *BF*\textsubscript{01} = 37.16; *F*(2, 324) = 0.17, *p* = 0.844].  RT differences between approach and avoid trials were also inspected and there was *strong* evidence for slower RTs on pull compared to push actions  after training [*BF*\textsubscript{10} = 11.32; *t*(162) = 2.95, *p* = 0.004, \textit{p\textsubscript{W}} = 0.002, *d* = 0.23, 95% CI for *d* = 0.08, 0.39]. Together these results may indicate fatigue effects associated with bio-mechanical costs (e.g., arm flexion muscle group activation).

#### Reliability of calculated bias scores {#ch2_reliability}

Given the absence of evidence for baseline approach-avoidance bias scores deviating from zero and the variability in their distributions (see Figure \ref{fig:ch2_raincloud_bias}), their test-retest reliability was explored. Considering that the interval between pre- and post-training AAT blocks was very short and there could be added variability due to the GNG training intervention, a test-retest reliability (or stability)  coefficient *r* within the range of 0.6-0.7 would be considered adequate in this context. Test-retest reliability was assessed via correlation pairs for AAT bias scores at baseline (AAT\textsubscript{pre}) and after training (AAT\textsubscript{post}), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ch2_test_retest}. Consistent with previous analyses (see section \ref{ch2_baseline_bias}), test-retest reliability was examined for both completion time and initiation time AAT bias scores. Bayesian correlation pairs with the default prior [stretched beta with $\gamma$=1; @wagenmakers_how_2016] were used for these analyses. As expected, there was *extreme* evidence for a positive linear relationship between completion time bias scores for pre- and post- training blocks, but the correlation coefficient (Pearson's rho) was only 0.41, indicating that the test-retest reliability of AAT bias scores based on completion times was poor [Log(\textit{BF}\textsubscript{10}) = 12.95\footnote{Log(\textit{BF}\textsubscript{10}): Natural logarithm of \textit{BF}\textsubscript{10}, where Log(\textit{BF}\textsubscript{10}) > 4.61 is equivalent to \textit{BF}\textsubscript{10} > 100.}, *p* < .001, 95% CI for *r* = 0.30, 1]. As discussed earlier, bias scores based on median completion times could be affected by noise in motor times and scores based on median initiation times would better reflect underlying cognitive processes, such as *automatic* action tendencies. The test-retest reliability for bias scores based on initiation times however was only slightly better compared to completion time bias scores with a stability coefficient of 0.53 [Log(\textit{BF}\textsubscript{10}) = 24.34, *p* < .001, 95% CI for *r* = 0.43, 1].

\captionof{figure}{\textbf{Scatterplots for the test-retest reliability of approach-avoidance bias scores.} For the preregistered analysis of training outcomes on automatic action tendencies (H1), approach-avoidance bias scores ($\Delta$AAT) were calculated based on median reaction times for correct pull and push responses from pre-to post-training (AAT\textsubscript{post} - AAT\textsubscript{pre}). These reaction times refer to the time participants took to complete an action (i.e., completion time). The test-retest reliability for the calculated scores was poor (Pearson’s \textit{r} coefficient = 0.41; see section \ref{ch2_reliability} for detailed results). When bias scores were computed using the time participants had taken to initiate a movement since stimulus onset on a correct trial (i..e, initiation times), the test-retest reliability was slightly improved (\textit{r} = 0.53) and less dispersion was observed for $\Delta$AAT across participants.}

#### Devaluation trends across training conditions {#ch2_devaluation_trends}

\par
As explained in Figure \ref{fig:ch2_raincloud_liking}, there was a general trend of devaluation in the data for all training conditions from pre- to post-training. These observed differences were tested directly and there was conclusive evidence that within each training condition cell, there was a negative change in mean liking ratings from pre- to post-training. The control (filler) foods should have been unaffected in terms of affective evaluation changes, but participants rated filler foods more negatively after training (*M* = 68.55, *SD* = 15.81) relative to baseline (*M* = 71.16, *SD* = 14.80) [*BF*\textsubscript{10} = 156.54, *t*(162) = 3.80, *p* < .001, \textit{p\textsubscript{W}} = 0.001, *d* = 0.30, 95% CI for *d* = 0.14, 0.45]. Contrary to predictions about the increase in positive evaluations for go foods (relative to control), within that condition cell the evaluations of go foods were less positive after training (*M* = 67.42, *SD* = 16.85) compared to before (*M* = 70.29, *SD* = 16.80) [*BF*\textsubscript{10} = 84.52, *t*(162) = 3.62, *p* < .001, \textit{p\textsubscript{W}} < .001, *d* = 0.28, 95% CI for *d* = 0.13, 0.44]. The effect was greater for no-go foods, but this is the only data trend that was theoretically consistent with effects of training. Participants provided less positive ratings for no-go foods after training (*M* = 68.83, *SD* = 16.81) compared to before (*M* = 72.99, *SD* = 15.38) [*BF*\textsubscript{10} = 211398.68, *t*(162) = 5.58, *p* < .001, \textit{p\textsubscript{W}} < .001, *d* = 0.44, 95% CI for *d* = 0.28, 0.60]. \newpage

#### General linear model of food choice data  {#ch2_glm}

\par
As shown in Figure 4 and as expected for counts data, food choice probabilities were not normally distributed and the inferences based on paired t-tests would need to be validated further. Choice count data from the impulsive food choice task were modelled using a general linear model (GLM) in R. The error term of the model was specified with a Poisson distribution and the link function log-transformed the linear predictor within the model (i.e., logarithms of fitted means). The only predictor in this model was the training condition (i.e.., go, no-go, or filler foods). Diagnostic plots showed mild violations of the assumptions of homoskedasticity and normality of residuals and thus robust standard errors for the parameter estimates were computed [@cameron_microeconometrics_2009]. An overdispersion test [@cameron_microeconometrics_2005; @kleiber_applied_2008] showed that true dispersion was not greater than 1 and the goodness-of-fit chi-squared test was not statistically significant, indicating that the model had a good fit (residual variance = 436.15, df = 486, *p* = 0.949). The GLM results are consistent with the preregistered statistical test results (see Table \ref{tab:ch2_prereg}). The model showed that impulsive choice probability for no-go foods was 0.53 times the choice probability for control foods [Estimate (log) = -0.617, Robust SE = 0.119,  *p* < .001, 95% CI = -0.851, -0.383)]. The probability of choosing a go food after training was 1.22 times the probability of choosing a control food [Estimate (log) = 0.197, Robust SE = 0.091, *p* = 0.030, 95% CI = 0.019, 0.374].

#### Robust statistics {#ch2_robust}

For certain preregistered paired comparisons, where the difference scores were found to violate the normality assumption (Shapiro-Wilk test with *p* $\leq$ 0.005), it was possible that effect size estimates were biased and therefore robust statistics are also reported [@lakens_20_2015]. H2a and H2b have been omitted as robust analyses have already been implemented above (see section \ref{ch2_glm}).

\par
Yuen's method of comparing trimmed means was applied via the WRS2 package, with the recommended percentage of 20% trimming from both tails of the distribution [@mair_robust_2019; @wilcox_measuring_2011; @yuen_two-sample_1974]. The explanatory measure of effect size $\xi$ is provided and can be conventionally interpreted as small, medium and large at 0.15, 0.35 and 0.50 [@mair_robust_2019]. The null hypothesis in Yuen's test for paired sample comparisons is that there is no difference between the trimmed means (\textit{$\mu$\textsubscript{t}}\textsubscript{1} = \textit{$\mu$\textsubscript{t}}\textsubscript{2}). The test results are shown in Table \ref{tab:ch2_robust} and were consistent with findings from preregistered confirmatory analyses. The explanatory effect sizes did not deviate in their interpretation from Cohen's *d* values presented in Table \ref{tab:ch2_prereg} for frequentists paired-samples t-tests, as the observed effects were small for both H3a and H4a. 

## Discussion  {#ch2_discussion}

The primary aim of the study was to investigate whether inhibitory control training (ICT) can have an effect on automatic action tendencies. This research question was based on previous theoretical ground for hard-wired mutually excitatory connections between appetitive/aversive centres and 'go'/'stop' systems that could lead to changes in the motivational value of stimuli included in training [@mclaren_association_2016; @verbruggen_inhibitory_2014]. The formulation of this research quesion was also based on the BSI theory of stimulus devaluation [@veling_when_2008], which argues that the devaluation process that occurs during training may lead to reduced approach bias for foods associated with response inhibition. It was hypothesised that approach bias for unhealthy foods associated with a no-go response during go/no-go training (i.e., response inhibition) would be reduced compared to filler foods that were paired with both go and no-go responses with an equal probability (control). Automatic action tendencies were indirectly measured using a variant of the approach-avoidance task (AAT) that includes a 'zooming' feature for push/pull actions [@neumann_approach_2000] of the computer mouse and requires participants to judge the orientation of the presented picture [@wiers_automatic_2013]. 

### No effects of training on automatic action tendencies
\par
As a primary outcome measure, the change in bias scores from pre-to post-training was examined across training conditions. Approach-avoidance bias scores were calculated from AAT blocks before and after training by subtracting median RTs on approach trials (pull action) from median RTs on avoid trials (push action). Positive scores would indicate an approach bias towards unhealthy foods. The results from the preregistered analyses showed that ICT did not have an effect on automatic action tendencies, as there was *moderate* evidence that approach bias for no-go foods was not reduced relative to control foods after training (H1a) as well as *strong* evidence that approach bias for go foods was not increased compared to control foods after training (H1b). Although such ICT effects may not have been previously investigated, there is empirical evidence to suggest that food stimuli included in AAT training protocols can be associated with increased avoidance behaviour (or reduced approach) after training [e.g., @dickson_pulling_2016; @schumacher_bias_2016]. A significant change in approach-avoidance bias scores was not observed in another series of experiments [@becker_approach_2015-1], but presence or absence of training effects may also depend on methodological parameters of training and employed controls [see @jonesCognitiveTrainingPotential2018 for review], as discussed further below (see section \ref{ch2_methodological_considerations}). 

### Response inhibition \& impulsive food choices
\par
As a secondary outcome measure, impulsive food choices were assessed via an adapted food choice task [@veling_stop_2013] after training. Participants had ten seconds to choose three food stimuli from all training conditions (go, no-go or control). preregistered analyses showed that the probability of choosing a no-go food was lower than the probability of choosing a control food (H2a). Meanwhile, there was no difference between the probability of choosing a go food relative to the probability of choosing a control food (H2b). The conclusion that ICT can have an effect on impulsive food choices is consistent with previous studies that have used both go/no-go and stop-signal task paradigms [@veling_using_2013; @veling_stop_2013], but cannot be directly compared to experiments involving cue-approach training, which involves responding to go items in response to a cue or signal. These studies have found increased food choices for go food items [@schonberg_changing_2014; @veling_training_2017]. Food choices can either be deliberate or impulsive (added time pressure in experimental settings) and hypothetical or consequential, whereby participants are aware that their choices will determine what food they are offered by the experimenter at the end of the study [e.g., see @chen_when_2019]. The present findings should therefore be replicated and extended with different experimental manipulations (e.g., speeded binary choice task). 

### Devaluation effects  \& design limitations
\par
Another important training outcome which was also treated as manipulation check for the ICT paradigm was the change in food evaluations from pre-to post-training. According to the BSI theory of stimulus devaluation, as already introduced, successful inhibition of responses on signal trials is facilitated by an underlying devaluation process for appetitive foods, whereby approach bias for these foods is reduced [@veling_what_2017; @veling_when_2008]. Consistent with previous studies where go/no-go training led to robust food devaluation effects [see @chen_how_2016 for a series of preregistered experiments], it was expected that the change in mean tastiness ratings (i.e., food liking) for no-go foods from pre-to post-training would be reduced compared to the change in ratings for filler foods. Preregistered analyses showed only *anecdotal* evidence that no-go foods were rated less positively after training compared to filler foods (H3a). Similarly, participants did not show increased liking for go foods relative to the filler foods, from pre-to post-training (H3b). It should be noted that filler foods which were associated with both go and no-go responses (50:50) are not an ideal control for devaluation effects, as @chen_how_2016 correctly point out that effects should be observed for two baselines in order for proper inferences to be made. They compared changes in evaluation for no-go foods compared to changes for go foods as well as changes for untrained food stimuli, which were never included in training. In their design, food stimuli sets were matched in valence before training. However, participants in this study were only presented with a fixed set of unhealthy foods which were considered appetitive (e.g., pizza, cake, crisps) and this was a viable limitation with regards to the examination of devaluation effects. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that devaluation is observed only when highly appetitive foods are associated with response inhibition [see @chen_how_2016].
\par
Exploratory analyses further showed that while on average no-go foods were rated less positively after training compared to before, there was a general devaluation trend for both go and control foods (see section \ref{ch2_devaluation_trends}). Although this observation could simply be attributed to regression to the mean [e.g., see Experiment 1 in @chen_how_2016], it is possible that `over-exposure' to specific food stimuli from all training conditions during the phases of the study (pre-training, training, and post-training) could have had a habituation effect on participants' affective evaluations at the end of the study. It is also unclear whether stimulus-response mappings in the AAT affected GNG manipulations, as for example a correct response on push trials may require response inhibition, whereby an initial approach tendency towards an appetitive food cue is inhibited. Following the theoretical framework of an *associative stop system*, go foods were also associated with an aversive centre through avoidance responses and no-go foods presented on approach trials were linked to an appetitive centre. This would mean that, at least to a certain extent, hard-wired connections between go/stop and appetitive/aversive centres [@verbruggen_inhibitory_2014] could have confounded expected effects on food evaluations. However, the absence of devaluation effects specific to no-go foods could not be attributed to ineffective training, as the second manipulation check for contingency learning during the go/no-go task was positive. There was *extreme* evidence that GoRTs on correct no-signal trials were reduced for go foods compared to control foods and that the percentage of correct responses on signal trials were greater for no-go foods relative to control foods. Overall, ICT outcomes for devaluation contradicted prior expectations, while taking into account that limitations of the experimental design may have had a significant impact on observed effects.  

### Methodological considerations for the approach-avoidance task {#ch2_methodological_considerations}
\par
There were several findings from exploratory analyses regarding the approach avoidance task that may explain the absence of ICT effects on automatic action tendencies and yielded methodological considerations for future studies.  First, overall baseline bias scores did not statistically deviate from zero (see section \ref{ch2_baseline_bias}), which suggests that either participants did not have any approach bias for the selected foods or the employed variant of the AAT was not sensitive enough to capture both baseline bias and potential effects of training. Sub-group analyses showed that even when participants had positive bias scores for unhealthy foods, which reflect existing approach bias, there were still no effects of training on automatic action tendencies (see section \ref{ch2_subgroup}). Consequently, the test-retest reliability of the calculated bias scores for pre-and post-training AAT blocks was inspected and the stability coefficients showed poor reliability (see section \ref{ch2_reliability}). Test-retest reliability was slightly improved when bias scores were calculated using initiation times, instead of completion times, which may be due to individual differences in action-associated motor demands (i.e., biceps and triceps muscle activation for pushing/pulling the computer mouse). We suggest that initiation time represents a more reliable measure for the calculation of AAT bias scores [e.g., see @seibt_prepared_2007-1]. It is also unclear whether any type of response latency measure derived from sensorimotor tasks, such as the AAT variant employed in this study, can be indicative of approach-avoidance bias, since the role of arm movements in these motivational processes has recently been questioned for the controversial replicability of findings and the importance of whole-body movements in real-world approach-avoidance behaviours [@rougier_new_2018]. An element of the AAT variant that could have affected the reliability of the bias scores was the use of a computer mouse instead of a joystick, as in the seminal version of this paradigm [@rinck_approach_2007; @wiers_relatively_2009]. However, any motor demand differences between the joystick and computer mouse would not affect the initiation times, which were also found to have questionable test-retest reliability. 
\par
The variability in methodology for the measurement of motivational bias should be taken into account, as different parameters might need to be examined further when the AAT is applied in the food domain [e.g., explicit vs implicit task instructions; see @phaf_approach_2014 for meta-analysis]. In a recent study, @lender_measurement_2018 found that the irrelevant-feature of the AAT did not lead to robust approach-bias, compared to relevant-feature variants which require participants to pay attention to the content of the stimuli. Setting aside the methodological utility of the AAT in this context, it is possible that go/no-go training with the specific parameters applied in this study, did not have an effect on automatic action tendencies, but this research question could be addressed in future empirical studies that utilise alternative measures of motivational bias, such as the relevant stimulus-response compatibility task [e.g., see @field_alcohol_2011] and tailor stimuli to participants' individual liking ratings.

### Concluding remarks \& future directions
\par
A thorough search of the literature did not indicate that the AAT has previously been employed as an outcome measure in ICT studies using the go/no-go training paradigm. I believe that the null findings presented here can shed light into methodological and theoretical issues that need to be explored further. From a theoretical standpoint, there could be a link between stimulus devaluation during ICT training and automatic action tendencies. If a tendency to approach an appetitive food is reduced during go/no-go training in order for response inhibition to be successful, the approach bias towards food stimuli associated with signal trials could be indirectly affected by this process. The absence of devaluation effects in this study could therefore explain the finding that ICT did not have any influence on automatic action tendencies. Nevertheless, there are several methodological limitations regarding the application of the AAT as an indirect measure of motivational bias that need to be addressed before drawing any conclusions and these could be addressed in future studies. On a final note, it is worth mentioning that there are various methodological parameters and protocols that can be implemented for both inhibitory control training and measurement of approach-avoidance bias and this can pose an important replicability issue.  It is recommended that novel findings, irrespective of statistical significance, are replicated and/or extended in a rigorous and reproducible manner, in an effort to reduce selective reporting and publication bias in this line of research [e.g., see @aulbach_implicit_2019; @carbineQuantifyingPresenceEvidential2019a].
